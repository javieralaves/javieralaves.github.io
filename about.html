    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h2>Personal bio</h2>
    <p>ðŸ‘‹ I'm a product designer, podcaster and writer, currently living in Berlin.</p>
    <p>I'm designing at Tribe, a platform where anyone can create their own social space. Before Tribe, I worked at Aragon on apps for decentralized collaboration as part of the Autark team across to major network grants.</p>
    <p>Before Autark, I worked across various startups as the founding partner in design. I've scaled two successful startups and worked for a year at a venture capital firm where I helped other projects scale.</p>
    <p>I'm about to launch a podcast with my colleague Soheil Alavi, open sourcing our design process at Tribe, and I occasionally write reflections and design retrospectives in my blog relating to my experiences in design.</p>
